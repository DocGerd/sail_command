// #38/#39 always-mounted map data layers. What this asserts (and why it's
// not theater): the depth toggle must exist BEFORE any plan (the whole point
// of the DataLayers host being a sibling of the plan-gated RouteLayer), and
// checking it must actually change the rendered map — a raster that never
// draws would pass any DOM-only assertion. Harbor markers/labels are canvas
// pixels with no DOM handle, so their look is covered by the manual
// real-browser pass instead of a brittle pixel-match here.

// #253 fix-up: this spec's `networkidle` wait was deleted with no
// replacement when maplibre-gl 6 stopped producing a `requestfinished` Playwright
// counts for its module-worker fetch. Without SOME readiness gate,
// `settledCanvas` below can settle on a PRE-TILE blank baseline (two
// byte-equal blank frames 250ms apart is MORE likely, not less, on a slow CI
// runner) — after which every `.equals(baseline)).toBe(false)` assertion
// would pass on the first late tile paint, never on the raster actually
// toggling. `mapReady` (`./helpers`, promoted from three independent copies
// of this gate — see that file's own comment) replaces it, gating on
// `map.loaded()` via a React-fiber-read map handle (this spec runs BEFORE
// any plan exists, so RouteLayer's `window.__scMap` test hook isn't set yet
// — the fiber read is the only handle available pre-plan).

// Polls until the canvas stops changing frame-to-frame (two consecutive
// byte-equal screenshots), then returns that settled frame. This replaces
// fixed waitForTimeout()s that fail both ways: too short → false fail (compare
// before the frame finished), and fire mid-render → false pass (a still-
// settling baseline differs from itself). Adaptive — returns as soon as stable,
// so it's usually fast; the attempt cap only guards a genuinely stuck page.
// CI is measurably slower than dev machines (CLAUDE.md: ~2.1x/~2.5x for the
// vitest unit suite, no equivalent Playwright/e2e figure measured), hence
// the generous cap — adaptive polling means it only costs real time when a
// page is genuinely slow, never on a normal run.
