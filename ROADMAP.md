# Roadmap

**Intent, not commitment.** This roadmap describes where SailCommand is headed
over roughly the next year (written 2026-07-27, so through mid-2027). It is a
statement of direction for users and prospective contributors, not a schedule
and not a promise. Items will move, slip, and get dropped — that is expected and
allowed. Nothing here creates an obligation on the maintainer, and dates are
deliberately absent because a single-maintainer hobby project cannot honor them
(see [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md)).

The authoritative, always-current view is the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues) and its
milestones. This file is the human-readable summary of that state, refreshed at
each release cut.

Current release: **v0.8.1**. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what has
shipped.

## Now — v0.9.0

The next feature release, tracked by the
[`v0.9.0` milestone](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/milestones) —
rolled forward by hand at the v0.8.0 cut (2026-08-03), per this repo's
per-release milestone convention (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Its **product**
scope is not yet decided; scope will be drawn from the themes below as work
is triaged into it, the same way v0.8.0's was. Two narrow follow-ups on that
cut's own coverage-timeout work are already filed and waiting for that
triage — [#357](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/357) (assert
the timeout budget against measured suite wall time, not just the heaviest
per-test budget) and
[#359](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/359) (restore the
job-cap coupling check with a real YAML parse). The `v0.8.1` patch release
(documentation-only — correcting an overstated CHANGELOG claim from v0.8.0)
shipped on 2026-08-04 and carried no milestone of its own, per this repo's
patch-milestone exception: it moved nothing above.

## Themes for the next year

Grouped by theme rather than by date. Ordering within a theme is not a
commitment either.

### Supply-chain and project-hygiene hardening

The project holds the [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/13749)
*passing* badge and is working toward *Silver*. A 2026-07 audit produced a
concrete, bounded set of gaps, most of which are documents or config rather than
product work. Done: governance, roles, Code of Conduct, this roadmap, a
security assurance case
([#217](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/217),
[#218](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/218),
[#219](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/219),
[#224](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/224)), a
Content-Security-Policy for the app shell
([#223](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/223)), named
coding standards with automated Python lint/format enforcement for
`pipeline/` ([#220](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/220)),
release-tag signing with documented verification
([#222](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/222),
[#322](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/322), including a
registered public signing key), and a statement-coverage gate: the 93.92%
measurement ([#221](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/221)) is
now wired into CI as an 80% floor
([#319](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/319),
[#342](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/342)) — checked
nightly rather than per-PR, since the fully v8-instrumented suite is far
slower than the plain one; see `docs/security-assurance-case.md` §7 for the
accepted gap that cadence leaves open. Remaining:

- The `signed_releases` criterion is a conjunction — cryptographic signing
  **and** a documented key-obtaining process (see `SECURITY.md`). Both
  mechanisms are live as of this cut, but the criterion is fully met only
  once the `v0.8.0` tag itself actually ships as the first signed release —
  both conjuncts together, not the mechanism alone, and that tag had not yet
  been pushed at the time this file was written (it follows this release
  PR's merge, per the release runbook).
- Tracking the remaining self-resolving OpenSSF Scorecard findings
  ([#72](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/72)).

One Silver criterion — `access_continuity` — cannot be closed by any change in
this repository. It requires a second person with standing release rights. See
[`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md#continuity-and-succession).

### Routing depth

The largest open product questions, all accepted into the backlog but none
scheduled:

- Currents, tides, and sea state (waves) in the isochrone cost
  ([#18](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/18)) — a design spec
  already exists at
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-waves-routing-design.md`. This is the
  single biggest change to routing accuracy the project could make, and also
  the biggest: it touches the data pipeline, the solver, and the UI.
- Multi-day trip planning with overnight stops and arrival-window checks
  ([#19](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/19)), which is bounded
  by the ~6-day forecast horizon.
- Multiple boat types with per-boat foresail inventories
  ([#54](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/54)) — today the app is
  hard-wired to one Salona 45 polar pair.

Note the tension with "Out of scope (v1)" in [`README.md`](README.md): currents,
tides, waves, and multi-day passages were excluded from v1 and remain excluded
from the shipped app. Their presence here means the exclusion is being
revisited, not that it has been lifted.

### Live view and on-board use

- A live-view simulator that replays or synthesizes a voyage, so GPS/AIS
  behavior can be tested without sailing
  ([#143](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/143)). This is the
  prerequisite for confidently changing anything in the Live view.
- Remaining map-chrome and small-screen issues beyond v0.6.0
  ([#231](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/231),
  [#232](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/232)).

### Development workflow

Not user-visible, but it is where a meaningful share of the effort goes and it
sets the pace of everything above. This cut closed out the items carried as
"remaining" since the last one: the conflict-free changelog-fragment
mechanism itself
([#189](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/189)) and the
agent-workflow guardrails alongside it — orchestrator-first enforcement,
a batch review-thread resolver, and the invocation-vs-mention hook-guard fix
([#211](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/211),
[#178](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/178),
[#235](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/235)). Three further
tooling-hardening items shipped alongside them: CI now runs every hook's own
`--selftest` suite, with `.github/scripts/classify-docs-only.sh` extracted
into a standalone script backed by a 34-case harness and pinned case counts
across all four pre-existing hooks, so a broken guard can no longer ship
green ([#334](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/334)); the
docs-only e2e-skip classify step, which gates `ci.yml`'s four expensive e2e
steps so a docs-only PR reports in seconds instead of paying a full run
([#327](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/327)); and the
notices-nudge hook now also catches `npm audit fix`/`npm dedupe`, which
previously rewrote `package-lock.json` silently without tripping it
([#313](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/313)). Centralizing
coverage-aware test timeouts and wiring the coverage measurement into CI are
covered under "Supply-chain" above, not repeated here
([#342](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/342),
[#319](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/319)) — the two
follow-ups it left open are listed under "Now" above
([#357](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/357),
[#359](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/359)). A
worktree-cleanup skill, deduplicating the graphify guidance to a single home,
and tag → GitHub Release automation from `CHANGELOG.md` shipped in v0.7.0
([#179](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/179),
[#183](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/183),
[#175](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/175)). Grouped
Dependabot updates and path→area PR labeling shipped in v0.6.0
([#174](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/174),
[#173](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/173)).

### Deferred (Icebox)

Parked deliberately, not stale — revisited opportunistically, and plausibly
never done:

- The five harbors that remain disconnected from the routable mask
  ([#9](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/9)). This one is
  **blocked on physics, not effort**: at the mask's ~46 m cell size the
  channels involved are sub-cell, and reconnecting them would mean fabricating
  depth data. It stays open only in case hi-res bathymetry becomes available.

## What the project does not intend to do

These are standing decisions, not gaps waiting to be filled. A pull request
implementing one of them will be declined on principle
([`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md#decisions-that-are-not-open-for-negotiation)).

- **No backend, ever.** No server, no proxy, no API of our own, no database.
  The wind forecast is fetched by the browser directly from Open-Meteo.
- **No accounts, no login, no user data collection.** Nothing to sign up for,
  nothing to breach. No analytics, telemetry, or tracking is present or planned.
- **Not a navigation device, and no ENC chart data.** SailCommand will not
  become a chartplotter, will not claim chart authority, and will not ship or
  integrate official electronic navigational charts. Official charts and your
  plotter remain authoritative.
- **No route sharing or collaboration features.** Plans stay on the device that
  created them. Export to GPX for a chartplotter is the intended interchange
  path.
- **No native iOS/Android applications.** SailCommand is an installable PWA;
  that is the whole delivery model.
- **No expansion beyond the Flensburg Fjord / Danish South Sea area
  (54.3–55.3°N, 9.4–11.0°E) within this horizon.** The committed mask, harbor
  list, and basemap are all built for that box. Widening it is a data-pipeline
  and app-size question that is not being worked on.
- **No paid tiers, sponsorship flows, or commercial offering.**

## How this roadmap is kept honest

Reviewed and updated at every release cut, alongside `README.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, and `GOVERNANCE.md`. If you find a statement here that no longer
matches the issue tracker, that is a bug worth filing — a roadmap that quietly
rots is worse than not having one.
