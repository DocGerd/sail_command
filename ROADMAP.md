# Roadmap

**Intent, not commitment.** This roadmap describes where SailCommand is headed
over roughly the next year (written 2026-07-27, so through mid-2027). It is a
statement of direction for users and prospective contributors, not a schedule
and not a promise. Items will move, slip, and get dropped — that is expected and
allowed. Nothing here creates an obligation on the maintainer, and dates are
deliberately absent because a single-maintainer hobby project cannot honor them
(see [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md)).

The authoritative, always-current view is the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues) and its
milestones. This file is the human-readable summary of that state, refreshed at
each release cut.

Current release: **v0.8.1**. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what has
shipped.

## Now — v0.10.0

The next feature release, tracked by the
[`v0.10.0` milestone](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/milestones) —
created empty at the v0.9.0 cut (2026-08-05), per this repo's per-release
milestone convention (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Its **product** scope is not
yet decided; scope will be drawn from the themes below as work is triaged
into it, the same way v0.9.0's was. The two coverage-timeout follow-ups
noted at the v0.8.0 cut were never triaged into v0.9.0 and remain open —
[#357](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/357) (assert the
timeout budget against measured suite wall time, not just the heaviest
per-test budget, currently carries no milestone) and
[#359](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/359) (restore the
job-cap coupling check with a real YAML parse, sitting in `Backlog`) —
either could land in v0.10.0 once triaged, or stay in `Backlog` again.

The `v0.9.0` cut (2026-08-05) closed out all 18 issues it carried: three
map/seamark correctness fixes (spar-lateral topmarks, black special-purpose
mark contrast on the dark basemap, the wind-barb slider's day indication —
[#307](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/307),
[#308](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/308),
[#292](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/292)); the
route-planning progress readout and the second-rig map overlay
([#340](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/340),
[#324](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/324)); a cluster of
narrow-viewport map-chrome fixes (offline banner overlap, the scale bar
painting over map chrome, the ownship marker's accessible name lost in the
6.1.0 bump —
[#368](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/368),
[#374](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/374),
[#361](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/361)); a route
annotation readability pass (ETA/speed labels culled or too small —
[#378](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/378)); three
investigated-but-not-built spikes, none of which changed any code
([#244](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/244) buoyed
fairways and [#245](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/245)
depth-mask resolution, both **declined** and cross-referenced from the
themes below;
[#296](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/296) lazy-loading map
data for offline coverage, a **recommendation** for future work rather than
a decline — nothing was implemented); a dev-only dependency security bump
([#369](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/369)); a CSP/build
guard hardening pair
([#320](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/320),
[#318](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/318)); and four
tooling/process items ([#392](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/392),
[#388](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/388),
[#383](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/383),
[#277](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/277)) covered under
"Development workflow" below. The `v0.8.1` patch release (documentation-only
— correcting an overstated CHANGELOG claim from v0.8.0) shipped on
2026-08-04 and carried no milestone of its own, per this repo's
patch-milestone exception: it moved nothing above.

## Themes for the next year

Grouped by theme rather than by date. Ordering within a theme is not a
commitment either.

### Supply-chain and project-hygiene hardening

The project holds the [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/13749)
*passing* badge and is working toward *Silver*. A 2026-07 audit produced a
concrete, bounded set of gaps, most of which are documents or config rather than
product work. Done: governance, roles, Code of Conduct, this roadmap, a
security assurance case
([#217](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/217),
[#218](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/218),
[#219](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/219),
[#224](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/224)), a
Content-Security-Policy for the app shell
([#223](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/223)), named
coding standards with automated Python lint/format enforcement for
`pipeline/` ([#220](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/220)),
release-tag signing with documented verification
([#222](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/222),
[#322](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/322), including a
registered public signing key), and a statement-coverage gate: the 93.92%
measurement ([#221](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/221)) is
now wired into CI as an 80% floor
([#319](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/319),
[#342](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/342)) — checked
nightly rather than per-PR, since the fully v8-instrumented suite is far
slower than the plain one; see `docs/security-assurance-case.md` §7 for the
accepted gap that cadence leaves open. The `signed_releases` criterion — a
conjunction of cryptographic signing **and** a documented key-obtaining
process (see `SECURITY.md`) — is now fully met: `v0.8.0` shipped as the
first signed tag, and `v0.8.1`/`v0.9.0` have followed it, so both conjuncts
are proven on real releases, not just the mechanism. (The `v0.8.0` tag
itself still shows GitHub's "Verified" badge as `no_user` rather than
verified — a tagger-identity attribution gap fixed going forward from
`v0.8.1`, not a signature problem; see the `v0.8.1` CHANGELOG entry. The
OpenSSF criterion cares about the signing mechanism and its documentation,
not that badge.) Remaining:

- Tracking the remaining self-resolving OpenSSF Scorecard findings
  ([#72](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/72)).

One Silver criterion — `access_continuity` — cannot be closed by any change in
this repository. It requires a second person with standing release rights. See
[`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md#continuity-and-succession).

### Routing depth

The largest open product questions, all accepted into the backlog but none
scheduled:

- Currents, tides, and sea state (waves) in the isochrone cost
  ([#18](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/18)) — a design spec
  already exists at
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-waves-routing-design.md`. This is the
  single biggest change to routing accuracy the project could make, and also
  the biggest: it touches the data pipeline, the solver, and the UI.
- Multi-day trip planning with overnight stops and arrival-window checks
  ([#19](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/19)), which is bounded
  by the ~6-day forecast horizon.
- Multiple boat types with per-boat foresail inventories
  ([#54](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/54)) — today the app is
  hard-wired to one Salona 45 polar pair.

Investigated and **declined** as a routing input this cut: honouring
buoyed fairways ([#244](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/244))
— the in-region OSM fairway data turned out to carry no width/depth/draft
tags and is over half canoe-scheme geometry, so a naive nearest-fairway
lookup would route a real boat down a paddling track; see
`docs/spikes/244-buoyed-fairways.md` for the full evidence and the
considered-and-rejected alternatives.

Note the tension with "Out of scope (v1)" in [`README.md`](README.md): currents,
tides, waves, and multi-day passages were excluded from v1 and remain excluded
from the shipped app. Their presence here means the exclusion is being
revisited, not that it has been lifted.

### Live view and on-board use

- A live-view simulator that replays or synthesizes a voyage, so GPS/AIS
  behavior can be tested without sailing
  ([#143](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/143)). This is the
  prerequisite for confidently changing anything in the Live view.
- Remaining map-chrome and small-screen issues beyond v0.6.0
  ([#231](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/231),
  [#232](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/232)).

### Development workflow

Not user-visible, but it is where a meaningful share of the effort goes and it
sets the pace of everything above. The v0.9.0 cut fixed four items in this
area: a stale-`node_modules` maplibre-gl citation in `CLAUDE.md` that had
already caused one wrong line-number claim
([#392](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/392)); the
artifact-guard Bash hook's read-only exemption, now conjunctive (exact verb
AND no write-capable construct anywhere) instead of the over-firing
first-word match that had been prompting on plain `stat` calls
([#388](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/388)); a
`compass.spec.ts` e2e flake root-caused to a real MapLibre defect — a bare
`this.stop()` at ease completion disarms an in-flight drag gesture entirely
— and closed test-side with an at-rest settle gate; the underlying MapLibre
defect itself remains open, tracked separately
([#383](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/383), underlying
defect [#391](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/391) in
`Backlog`); and an e2e regression pin for the #205 narrow-width overlap fix
([#277](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/277)).

The v0.8.0 cut closed out the items carried as "remaining" since the one
before it: the conflict-free changelog-fragment mechanism itself
([#189](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/189)) and the
agent-workflow guardrails alongside it — orchestrator-first enforcement,
a batch review-thread resolver, and the invocation-vs-mention hook-guard fix
([#211](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/211),
[#178](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/178),
[#235](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/235)). Three further
tooling-hardening items shipped alongside them: CI now runs every hook's own
`--selftest` suite, with `.github/scripts/classify-docs-only.sh` extracted
into a standalone script backed by a 34-case harness and pinned case counts
across all four pre-existing hooks, so a broken guard can no longer ship
green ([#334](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/334)); the
docs-only e2e-skip classify step, which gates `ci.yml`'s four expensive e2e
steps so a docs-only PR reports in seconds instead of paying a full run
([#327](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/327)); and the
notices-nudge hook now also catches `npm audit fix`/`npm dedupe`, which
previously rewrote `package-lock.json` silently without tripping it
([#313](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/313)). Centralizing
coverage-aware test timeouts and wiring the coverage measurement into CI are
covered under "Supply-chain" above, not repeated here
([#342](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/342),
[#319](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/319)) — the two
follow-ups it left open never got triaged into v0.9.0 and are listed under
"Now" above
([#357](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/357),
[#359](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/359)). A
worktree-cleanup skill, deduplicating the graphify guidance to a single home,
and tag → GitHub Release automation from `CHANGELOG.md` shipped in v0.7.0
([#179](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/179),
[#183](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/183),
[#175](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/175)). Grouped
Dependabot updates and path→area PR labeling shipped in v0.6.0
([#174](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/174),
[#173](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/173)).

A spike into lazy-loading map data for offline coverage during multi-day
trips landed as a recommendation only, with nothing implemented yet
([#296](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/296),
`docs/spikes/296-lazy-load-map-data.md`): keep the mask, harbours, seamarks,
and polars monolithic and eager, but split the basemap into an eager "core"
archive plus per-region archives fetched and pinned per plan, gated by a
network-free, byte-length-verified completeness check.

### Deferred (Icebox)

Parked deliberately, not stale — revisited opportunistically, and plausibly
never done:

- The five harbors that remain disconnected from the routable mask
  ([#9](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/9)). This one is
  **blocked on physics, not effort**: at the mask's ~46 m cell size the
  channels involved are sub-cell, and reconnecting them would mean fabricating
  depth data. It stays open only in case hi-res bathymetry becomes available.
  A spike this cut ([#245](https://github.com/DocGerd/sail_command/issues/245),
  `docs/spikes/245-depth-mask-resolution.md`) confirmed this by rebuilding
  the mask end-to-end at 23 m and 12 m: none of the five reconnect at either
  resolution (at the default 3.0 m safety depth), and two currently-connected
  harbors disconnect instead — refining the grid is a measured regression
  here, not merely an untried option.

## What the project does not intend to do

These are standing decisions, not gaps waiting to be filled. A pull request
implementing one of them will be declined on principle
([`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md#decisions-that-are-not-open-for-negotiation)).

- **No backend, ever.** No server, no proxy, no API of our own, no database.
  The wind forecast is fetched by the browser directly from Open-Meteo.
- **No accounts, no login, no user data collection.** Nothing to sign up for,
  nothing to breach. No analytics, telemetry, or tracking is present or planned.
- **Not a navigation device, and no ENC chart data.** SailCommand will not
  become a chartplotter, will not claim chart authority, and will not ship or
  integrate official electronic navigational charts. Official charts and your
  plotter remain authoritative.
- **No route sharing or collaboration features.** Plans stay on the device that
  created them. Export to GPX for a chartplotter is the intended interchange
  path.
- **No native iOS/Android applications.** SailCommand is an installable PWA;
  that is the whole delivery model.
- **No expansion beyond the Flensburg Fjord / Danish South Sea area
  (54.3–55.3°N, 9.4–11.0°E) within this horizon.** The committed mask, harbor
  list, and basemap are all built for that box. Widening it is a data-pipeline
  and app-size question that is not being worked on.
- **No paid tiers, sponsorship flows, or commercial offering.**

## How this roadmap is kept honest

Reviewed and updated at every release cut, alongside `README.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, and `GOVERNANCE.md`. If you find a statement here that no longer
matches the issue tracker, that is a bug worth filing — a roadmap that quietly
rots is worse than not having one.
